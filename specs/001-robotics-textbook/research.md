## Language/Version for Code Examples

-   **Decision**: Python will be the primary and sole language used for all code examples within the textbook, specifically for `rclpy` and any other conceptual code snippets.
-   **Rationale**: Focusing on a single language (Python) ensures consistency, clarity, and simplicity for the target audience. Introducing other languages for conceptual examples would unnecessarily increase the complexity of the material and potentially dilute the learning focus, conflicting with the "Simplicity" principle of the constitution.
-   **Alternatives considered**: Using multiple languages (e.g., C++ alongside Python) for illustrative purposes. This was rejected to maintain pedagogical clarity and avoid overwhelming the target student audience, who are expected to have a computer science or robotics background, implying familiarity with Python is a reasonable prerequisite for ROS 2.
